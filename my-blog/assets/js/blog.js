//Load DOM after HTML runs.

//Use JSON.parse to get the blogPosts from localStorage. Use || [] to initialize it as an empty array if there are no posts to retrieve. 

// Create a const variable to be a container for the blog posts. That way there is a reference to the container where the blog posts will show.

// Use a forEach loop to go through each item in array and run the function given for each item. It will allow me
// to go through each blog post and make an HTML element for it.

// Need another create const variable to create a new div element so that there can be a new container for each blog post on the page.

// Make sure to apply the CSS styles to the div element. And then populate the div element with the blog post. 

// Append to container.

// Sleect the element with ID back button and andd event listener for a click. window.location.href it back to index.html.

// Make another one to toggle dark mode.
